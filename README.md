# System() NPAPI Plugin

Web browser NPAPI plugin for calling command line tools

This is a web browser plugin. When installed, the JavaScript can invoke local command line tools such as `ls`.

This plugin is very dangerous because remote web page can use it to control you system.

It should be only used as a demo on how to write NPAPI plugins, or used in a local demo/test environment.
